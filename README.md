# Silk

Welcome to silk, a neat little wrapper around haxelib that provides convience and brings in features from other package managers.

Dependencies 
## Features
- Aliases for install, info, and options
- Support for specifying git versions like you can in yarn
- Still uses haxelib under the hood, meaning it has full compatibility with normal haxe

## Building
You can just run build.hxml; it only requires neko, which you should already have installed
