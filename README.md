# Silk

Welcome to silk, a neat little wrapper around haxelib that provides convience and brings in features from other package managers.

## Features
- Aliases for install, info, and options
- Support for specifying git versions like you can in yarn
- Still uses haxelib under the hood, meaning it has full compatibility with normal haxe

## Building
Right now there are no prebuilt builds but you can create it easily (if you can build cpp haxe) 

You can look at the [haxe manual](https://haxe.org/manual/target-cpp-getting-started.html) to see what you need to build cpp.

Just run `haxe build.hxml`
